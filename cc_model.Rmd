## Introduction

Clock-checking behavior is influenced by both an individual's estimated time and random guessing, independent of the estimated time. This time estimation is a noisy process, with variance increasing proportional to the square of the elapsed time, as established in previous studies (Gibbon et al, 1984; Ren et al, 2021). The probability that the target time has been exceeded is derived from this noisy time estimation. 

This probability is transformed into an action probability (clock check) using a sigmoid (IRT-like) function. The overall distribution of clock checks is calculated based on the probability of action, which serves as a hazard function, and the survival function, defined as \(1 - \int_0^t \text{hazard}(t) dt\). Below, we outline the simulation and model these processes step-by-step.

## Key Functions and Components

### Target Time Probability

The probability that the estimated time has exceeded the target time is given by:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)

# Function to calculate the probability of the target being exceeded
prob_target <- function(t_target, t_step, k) {
  return(1 - pnorm(t_target, t_step, k * t_step))
}
